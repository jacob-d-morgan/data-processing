%% Sample Type Timeline
% Plots a 'timeline' of the different categories of the imported data. This
% allows me to identify the different batches of CS, LJA, and which ice
% cores they are applied to.
% It also allows me to manually plot the date of significant changes to the
% MS, such as a refocussing, or significant adjustments to the method, such
% as the implementation of the O2-consumption correction.
